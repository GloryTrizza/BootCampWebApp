A certain company specializes in hosting coding boot camps. Students who enroll in these boot camps are accommodated, fed, and trained by the company for a period of two weeks.

After the two-week boot camp is over, the company is very interested in the studentsâ€™ feedback. Create a web application that is able to collect feedback for this company. The company wants all students to answer the following question below:

<li>The accommodation</li>

<li>The trainers</li>
